Bluelog is a simple Bluetooth scanner designed to tell you how many discoverable
devices there are in an area as quickly as possible.It is intended to be used as
a site survey tool, identifying the number of possible Bluetooth targets there
are in the surrounding environment.

I wrote Bluelog because there didn't appear to be any Bluetooth scanner for
Linux that would simply log discoverable devices without also doing a whole
bunch of other stuff I didn't really need.

Of course, in the end I managed to expand Bluelog into doing a whole bunch of
other stuff I didn't really need. But at least I still kept it optional, so you
can always stick with the basics if that is all you want.

- Compatibility                                                                -
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bluelog has been written with portability and efficiency in mind, so it is able
to run on a number of systems and hardware platforms. Basically, as long as the
device can run (and get results from) "hcitool scan", and you can compile
software for it, there is a good chance Bluelog can run on it.

In addition to running on all major Linux distributions, Bluelog has been used
successfully on Chrome OS (running on the CR-48 netbook), and is included in
OpenWRT.

- Linux Kernel 3.0.x Bug                                                       -
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please note that there is a fatal bug in the Linux 3.0.x kernel series which
completely breaks Bluetooth scanning. This bug effects ALL software which uses
Bluetooth, not just scanners like Bluelog. It will even hinder normal usage of
Bluetooth, since it's pretty hard to pair a new device to your computer if you
can't even scan for one.

If your distribution is running Linux 3.0.x (such as Ubuntu 11.10 or Mint 12),
you'll need to upgrade to AT LEAST the 3.1 series to use Bluetooth.

You can read more about this bug on the linux-kernel mailing list:

http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=131629118406044

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Requirements                                                                 -
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bluelog's only software requirement is BlueZ, and naturally your system must
have at least one Bluetooth adapter connected to it. Any Bluetooth adapter
supported under Linux should work with Bluelog.

On Debian based systems like Ubuntu, you may need to install the "dev" version
of the BlueZ package, which will probably be called something like
"libbluetooth-dev". Debian breaks up the libraries from the main packages, so
simply having the BlueZ package installed won't be enough.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Installation                                                                 -
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To compile Bluelog, simply run the command "make" in this directory. If you get
any message about missing libraries, use your distribution's package manager to
install them. This will let you run Bluelog from the current directory for a
quick test, but not install it to the system.

To actually install Bluelog, use the command "make install". Since this will
install Bluelog to the system directories, you will need to run this as root or
through sudo.

When and if you want to remove Bluelog, you would use the command "make
uninstall". As with "install", this makes changes to the system directories and
will therefore require root permissions.

In addition, if you are upgrading from a previous version, there is also the
command "make upgrade". This will remove any older versions of Bluelog, compile
the new version, and finally install it to the system. As you might have
guessed, this also requires root permissions.

Finally, if you plan on using "Bluelog Live", check out the README.LIVE file
for information on the extra steps required.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Usage                                                                        -
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As of the current version, Bluelog supports the following options:

-i <hci interface or MAC>
    This option tells Bluelog which Bluetooth device you want to scan with.
You can use either the HCI device name (like hci2) or the MAC of the local
adapter. As a bonus, if you give a device which doesn't exist, Bluelog will
fall back on autodetection to find a working device. 

-o <filename>
    This is the filename of the log file to write. Default is "devices.log" in
the current directory.

-r <retries>
   This option sets how many attempts Bluelog should make to resolve a device
name. For various reasons (poor link, busy device, etc, etc), devices won't
always respond to a name request in a timely manner. This fills the logs or
Live display with un-named devices which look, frankly, uncool. By default,
Bluelog will make 3 attempts to resolve a device name, using this option you
can set that count to either be lower (faster, but less accurate), or higher
(slower, but possibly more accurate).

-a <minutes>
   This option enables "amnesia mode", which causes Bluelog to forget it has
seen a particular device after a set amount of time, given here as minutes.
When Bluelog encounters a device it has forgotten through this option, it
will print it to the logs again as if it was the first time it has been
seen, and the time found will be updated.

-b
   This option will set the log format so that the resulting data is suitable
for upload to ronin's Bluetooth Profiling Project (BlueProPro). This overrides
most other logging options and disables Bluelog Live. For more information on
this project, and the additional steps required to submit your data for
inclusion, visit: www.hackfromacave.com

-c
   This option toggles writing the raw device class to the log file. Enabling
this option disables the -f option. Default is disabled.

-d
   This option will daemonize Bluelog so that it runs in the background. You
will still see the boilerplate and startup messages, but after that you will
no longer see any info from Bluelog in the terminal. Instead, status messages
and device discovery will be reported to syslog (in addition, of course, to
Bluelog's log files or Bluelog Live).

-f
   This option takes the device class and interprets it into a more human
friendly format. It will tell you what class the device is and also what it's
core capabilities are. For example, the class "0x7a020c" would appear as:
"Smart Phone,(Net Capture Obex Audio Phone)". Enabling this option disables the
-c option. Default is disabled.

-k
   When running an instance of Bluelog in daemon mode, the -k option can be
used to kill it.

-l
   This option switches Bluelog over to Live mode, which uses an automatically
updated web page to show results rather than the console and regular log files.
See README.LIVE for more details.

-n
    Use this option to toggle displaying device names for discovered devices.
Finding the device name takes extra time during scanning, and occasionally
fails. Therefore by not resolving device names, Bluelog can scan faster and
more accurately. Default is disabled.

-t
    Use this option to toggle displaying timestamps for both the start and end
of the scan and each new device found in the log file. Default is disabled.

-v
    Use this option to toggle displaying found devices on the console. Verbose
output will also contain device class information and timestamps. Default is
disabled.

-x
   Use this option to toggle MAC address obfuscation. This allows you to
release your log files without (completely) compromising the identity of the
scanned devices. Default is disabled. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Basic Scanning                                                               -
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There isn't a whole lot to say about this one. Start up Bluelog with the
appropriate options, and then just walk/drive around the area and see what you
come up with.

For your first scan, try something simple like:

$ bluelog -vtn

This will turn on verbose output, timestamps, and device names, and output
to the default file "devices.log". There are a number of other options which
you can use to customize the level of logging Bluelog will do, but most people
will probably be happy with just the time, MAC, and device name.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Bluelog Live                                                                 -
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Bluelog Live" is an alternate interface for Bluelog. Instead of outputting
discovered devices to the console, or writing them to the sparse log file,
Bluelog will create a web page with the results that you can serve up for
anyone who cares to look.

For more information on Bluelog Live, please see the README.LIVE file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Daemon Mode                                                                  -
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Running Bluelog with the -d option will start it in daemon mode, which puts it
into the background. This mode is especially useful when running Bluelog Live.

Only one instance of Bluelog can run at a time, so if you attempt to start
Bluelog (in either daemon or interactive mode) while it is already running in
daemon mode, you will be prompted to kill the existing process. You can use the
-k option to kill a running Bluelog process, or simply find the process with
ps and kill it manually.

It is worth noting that enabling daemon mode also overrides some other options,
such as verbose mode (since there is no terminal output once Bluelog goes into
the background).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Packaging                                                                    -
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bluelog's Makefile supports using environment variables to modify the
installation so it can be more easily built into a binary package for your
distribution. You can pass compiler options and the installation directory to
the Makefile like so:

$ make CFLAGS="-O2 -march=i486 -mtune=i686"
gcc -O2 -march=i486 -mtune=i686 -lbluetooth bluelog.c -o bluelog
$ mkdir ./pkg
$ make install DESTDIR=./pkg
mkdir -p ./pkg/usr/bin/
mkdir -p ./pkg/usr/share/doc/bluelog-0.9.6/
mkdir -p ./pkg/var/lib/bluelog/
cp bluelog ./pkg/usr/bin/
cp ChangeLog COPYING README TODO ./pkg/usr/share/doc/bluelog-0.9.6/
cp -a --no-preserve=ownership www/* ./pkg/var/lib/bluelog/

This allows you to easily script the build process and create a package using
the package creation software for your distribution of choice.

If you are able to build packages for your distribution, please let me know and
we can work something out for hosting them on the site.

The initial code for Bluelog was based on sample code included in the book
"Bluetooth Essentials for Programmers", by Albert Huang. This is a very
informative book, and helps a lot if you are looking to get into BlueZ
programming. It almost makes up for the terrible documentation from the BlueZ
project.

The website for this book is located at: http://www.btessentials.com/

Bluelog also implements device class parsing code from "Inquisition", written
by Michael John Wensley and released under the GPLv2.

You can read more about "Inquisition" from his site: http://www.wensley.org.uk/

The device cache rewrite took inspiration, if not literal code, from
"SpoofTooph" by .ronin. You can check out "SpoofTooph" and .ronin's other
projects on his site: http://www.hackfromacave.com/

Bluelog also uses some code inspired by functions from pidfile.c by
Martin Schulze.

The OpenWRT version of Bluelog would not have been possible without the work
of Gary Bonner and the logistical support of Joshua Hurst.

Finally, a special thanks to those who have donated Bluetooth devices to me for
calibration purposes. Writing a Bluetooth scanner without any devices to scan
is rather difficult, so the hardware has been very valuable to me.
